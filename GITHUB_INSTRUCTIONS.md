# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to push this Telegram bot project to your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your system
2. Make sure you have a GitHub account

## Steps to Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., "telegram-access-token-bot")
   - Add a description if you want
   - Keep the repository public or private as per your preference
   - **Important:** Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Copy the repository URL:**
   - After creating the repository, you'll see a page with quick setup instructions
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (it will look like `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`)

3. **Add the remote origin and push:**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory
   - Run the following commands, replacing `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL` with the URL you copied:
   
   ```bash
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   For example:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/telegram-access-token-bot.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Verify the push:**
   - Refresh your GitHub repository page
   - You should now see all the project files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Authentication problems:**
   - Make sure you're using the correct credentials
   - Consider using a Personal Access Token instead of your password

2. **If the repository already has content:**
   - You might need to force push (only if you're sure you want to overwrite):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main --force
   ```

3. **If you get "remote already exists" error:**
   - Remove the existing remote and add the new one:
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   ```
